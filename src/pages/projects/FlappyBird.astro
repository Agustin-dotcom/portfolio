      <p>
        <strong>Flappy Bird</strong> is a simple yet addictive game where players control a bird trying to fly through obstacles without hitting them.
        This game has been one of the most popular games for years.
      </p>

      <p>
        The game mechanics rely on basic physics with velocity and acceleration controlling the birdâ€™s motion. 
        The pipes are randomly generated with varying heights. 
        A simple counter has been added to achive the highest score.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game was initially developed using <strong>Processing</strong>, a powerful sketch-based framework for creative coding, known for its ease of use in prototyping visual applications.  
        To deploy the game on the web, the project was adapted to <strong>p5.js</strong>, a JavaScript library based on Processing, allowing integration with HTML5 and web technologies.  
        The canvas rendering is handled through the p5.js framework, using key event listeners and a main game loop to control animations, collision detection, and user interactions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional features, such as custom sprite animations are implemented using p5.js methods like <code>loadImage()</code>, further enhancing the gameplay experience.
        Future improvements could include implementing a leaderboard using a backend service with <strong>REST APIs</strong> as used in other projects 
        and introducing more complex procedural generation for increased difficulty over time.
